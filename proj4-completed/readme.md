## Code Breakdown

This JavaScript code generates a list of courses and displays it on a webpage. The list of courses is stored in an array of objects, where each object represents a course and has a "name" and "price" property.

The function "generateLIST" creates a new unordered list item for each course in the "courses" array. For each course, the function creates a list item, adds a text node with the course name and a text node with the course price, and finally appends the list item to the unordered list.

The code listens for the "load" event on the window object and when the event fires, it calls the "generateLIST" function to create and display the list of courses.

The code also listens for a "click" event on a button with class "sort-btn". When the button is clicked, it sorts the "courses" array in ascending order by price and calls the "generateLIST" function again to update the displayed list.
